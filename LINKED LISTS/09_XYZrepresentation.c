// Let the number "XYZ" be represented as Z->Y->X in the linked list. If two such numbers are given in two different linked lists, then with the above representation, write a C-program to subtract the second number (represented in the second linked list) from the first number (represented in the first linked list) and store the result in the third linked list with above representation.

void(int num1, int num2){
    backNum1 = num1;
    backNum2 = num2;
    while(num1 > 0)

        head1->data = num1 % 10;
        num1 = num1 / 10;
